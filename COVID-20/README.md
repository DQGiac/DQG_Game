## Plot
What if... the coronavirus started in 2020??<br>
This universe's coronavirus is much more deadly, killing thousands with 100% fatal rate. After infected, these people became brain dead, and is controlled by the virus.<br>
The protagonist is a boy finding shelter for the night. Can he make it to the next house without being infected by the Covics (COVID victims)?
<br><br>
## Future developments
I have all the plot and the style of COVID-20 part 2. It will be a platformer with more action style gameplay.<br>
Date of release: possibly never :) (too little time + tired lol)
