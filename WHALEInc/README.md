## Game development
Made in a week for SeaJam, a game jam hosted by PolyMars and Barji to raise awareness for #TeamSeas.<br>
The first proper game for a jam, with mediocre graphics and ok gameplay (the finals exams was around the corner lol) but pretty proud. Made a second much more-polished version.<br>
