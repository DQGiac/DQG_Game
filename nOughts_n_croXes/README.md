## Game development
A fun project made in 5 days as a self-test to create a better/more enhanced version of a game.<br>
I'd say I focused much more on perfecting the aesthetic of it rather than the gameplay itself. This trade-off was not that good ig, there's still a few bugs in the game, but I really love the look and I'm quite proud :)<br>
