How to use this font:
With the ttf file:
 1. Open the file :)
 2. On the upper left corner are 2 buttons that say "Print" and "Install".
 3. Click "Install"
With the png file: Open it in PAINT!

And you are done :)
You can use this font anywhere you want, credits are NOT necessary! (But u'll be cool if u do :D). However, all that I am asking is DO NOT RESELL IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! :)

Thank you SO MUCH for downloading my font! luv uuuuuu ❤❤
